            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>PhotoPDF ("the App") is a mobile application developed by Latif Mamun that allows users to select images, apply filters and adjustments, add watermarks and signatures, and export them as PDF documents. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled responsibly.</p>
            <p>The App operates entirely locally on your device and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data with third parties or servers. All processing, including image filtering, PDF creation, and printing, occurs on your device.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The App does not collect any personal information automatically. However, to function properly, it may access certain data with your explicit permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Images and Photos:</strong> The App allows you to select images from your device's gallery or capture new photos using the camera. These images are processed locally to apply filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia, black & white), adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation), rotations, watermarks, signatures, and simple annotations. The images are not stored or transmitted outside your device unless you choose to export or print the resulting PDF.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> We request permission to read and write to your device's storage to access images and save PDF files to your Downloads folder.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> If you choose to capture images directly within the App, we request camera permission. Captured images are saved to your device's media storage and processed locally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No other data, such as location, contacts, or device identifiers, is collected or accessed by the App.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>All data accessed by the App is used solely for the purpose of providing its core functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing selected or captured images to apply user-chosen filters and adjustments.</li>
                <li>Adding optional watermarks, signatures, and annotations.</li>
                <li>Generating PDF documents from the processed images.</li>
                <li>Saving the PDF to your device's storage or sending it to a printer via the system's print service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any other purposes. The App does not connect to the internet and performs all operations offline.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any of your information to third parties. The App does not integrate with any external services, social media, or cloud storage. Any sharing of the generated PDF files is entirely under your control (e.g., via email or file sharing apps on your device).</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, the security of your information depends on the security measures of your device. We recommend keeping your device updated and using secure passwords. The App supports optional password protection for exported PDFs (using PDFBox, if enabled), but this is handled locally and does not involve any external servers.</p>
            <p>Note: Temporary files or cached data may be stored on your device during processing but are not retained after the App is closed.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App's functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted within the App or on our website (if applicable), and the effective date will be revised accordingly. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
