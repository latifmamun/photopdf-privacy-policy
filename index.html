            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>PhotoPDF ("the App") is a mobile application developed by Latif Mamun that allows users to select images, apply filters and adjustments, add watermarks and signatures, and export them as PDF documents. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled responsibly.</p>
            <p>The App performs image and PDF processing entirely locally on your device and does not transmit your images or personal files to external servers. However, the App integrates with Google AdMob to display interstitial advertisements, which may collect certain device and usage data for ad personalization and analytics. All core app functionality (image processing, PDF creation, and printing) occurs offline, but ad loading requires an internet connection.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The App collects limited information to provide its functionality and display ads. We access certain data with your explicit permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Images and Photos:</strong> The App allows you to select images from your device's gallery or capture new photos using the camera. These images are processed locally to apply filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia, black & white), adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation), rotations, watermarks, signatures, and simple annotations. The images are not stored or transmitted outside your device unless you choose to export or print the resulting PDF.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> We request permission to read and write to your device's storage to access images and save PDF files to your Downloads folder.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> If you choose to capture images directly within the App, we request camera permission. Captured images are saved to your device's media storage and processed locally.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad-Related Data:</strong> Through Google AdMob, the App may collect anonymous device information such as device ID (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address, approximate location (derived from IP), app usage data, and crash reports. This data is used by Google to serve personalized ads and improve ad performance. We do not directly collect or access this data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No other data, such as location (beyond ad purposes), contacts, or precise device identifiers outside of ad serving, is collected or accessed by the App.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>All data accessed by the App is used solely for the purpose of providing its core functionality and displaying ads:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing selected or captured images to apply user-chosen filters and adjustments.</li>
                <li>Adding optional watermarks, signatures, and annotations.</li>
                <li>Generating PDF documents from the processed images.</li>
                <li>Saving the PDF to your device's storage or sending it to a printer via the system's print service.</li>
                <li>Serving and personalizing advertisements via Google AdMob to support the App's development and maintenance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your personal files or images for advertising or analytics. Ad-related data is handled by Google AdMob in accordance with their policies.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Advertising</h2>
            <p>The App displays interstitial ads provided by Google AdMob. These ads may be personalized based on your device information and app usage. Google may use cookies or similar technologies to track ad interactions. For more information on how Google handles ad data, please review Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob Policies</a>.</p>
            <p>You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings (e.g., via Google's Advertising ID settings on Android). Ads are shown at intervals, such as on app resume or before exporting PDFs, but do not interrupt core functionality beyond brief displays.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal files or images to third parties. However, ad-related data collected by Google AdMob may be shared with Google's partners for ad serving and measurement purposes, as described in Google's policies. The App does not integrate with any other external services, social media, or cloud storage. Any sharing of the generated PDF files is entirely under your control (e.g., via email or file sharing apps on your device).</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Safety</h2>
            <p>We prioritize the safety and security of your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All image and PDF operations are performed on your device, minimizing exposure to external risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> We only request necessary permissions (storage, camera) and do not access data without your consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad Data Handling:</strong> AdMob data is anonymized and handled securely by Google. We do not store or access ad-related data ourselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Optional PDF password protection (if enabled) uses local encryption to secure exported files.</li>
                <li><strong>No Data Retention:</strong> The App does not retain your images or PDFs after processing; temporary data is cleared when the App is closed.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> We comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA where relevant. You can request data deletion by uninstalling the App, as no data is stored on servers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have concerns about data safety, contact us for more details.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Since core processing occurs locally on your device, the security of your information depends on the security measures of your device. We recommend keeping your device updated, using secure passwords, and enabling device encryption. The App supports optional password protection for exported PDFs (using PDFBox, if enabled), but this is handled locally and does not involve any external servers.</p>
            <p>Note: Temporary files or cached data may be stored on your device during processing but are not retained after the App is closed. For ads, Google AdMob employs industry-standard security measures to protect transmitted data.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App's functionality (e.g., ad integration) or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted within the App or on our website (if applicable), and the effective date will be revised accordingly. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
